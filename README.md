Abstract. 
This paper introduces Information Continuity Theory (ICT), a conceptual framework that defines life as the persistence of structured information through time via reproduction. Rather than treating organisms, genes, or fitness as primary explanatory units, ICT identifies information capable of generational continuity as the fundamental entity of life. Evolution is reframed as the historical outcome of differential informational persistence under environmental constraints. The theory is substrate-independent and applies to biological, cultural, and artificial systems. Implications for artificial life and artificial intelligence are discussed.
